# MSXClone
A poorly written and unfinished clone of Minesweeper X in C and raylib.

Originally created because you can't resize the MSX window and it's really annoying to play on a high DPI monitor (it's carpal tunnel: the game), also cause I liked the skin feature MSX has.
Written poorly in C with the help of raylib (goated library), it's an attempt at rewriting a Minesweeper clone called Minesweeper X. A clone of a clone. It's unfinished and abandoned. Written on and for Windows.
